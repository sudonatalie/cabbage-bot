## Commands
### `!cabbagebot`
Posts a random image of cabbage. Unless you're an imposter cabbagebot.

### `!mrscabbagebot`
Cabbages are married to bananas, so naturally, posts a random image of a banana.

### `!cabbage{boy,baby,dog}`
Some curated cabbage images.

### `!cabbageai`
Cabbage Bot is an avid Fortnite player and is learning to speak by reading [/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/). Unfortunately, this command is fairly buggy and often leads our bot to trail off talking about cabbage.
